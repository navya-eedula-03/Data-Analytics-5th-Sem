## Clarifications:

1.  **monthly rate** refers to the monthly cost of the employee. This would be the sum of salary, insurance, etc.

2. **Performance:** Values are only 3 or 4. I have considered that people are working very well. Work activities and tasks are not the problems of attrition, maybe others such as environment, management. Another explanation could be high management control, mainly "micromanagement".

3. **Employee count** is almost useless since it repeats itself. **Employee number** is the most important since it is the unique identifier i.e.., primary key.

4. **Clarification regarding monthly rate and monthly income -**

    can be helpful. Each organization has a different pay system. How the salaries are being computed in this data set is not yet clear. I understand it's a fictitious data set, still giving meaningful information helps in doing some sensible analysis.

## Definitions and Meanings:

1. **Attrition** - The term attrition refers to a gradual but deliberate reduction in staff numbers that occurs as employees retire or resign and are not replaced.
2. **Monthly rate** is the internal charge out rate which will be used to calculate the cost of each employee monthly, in general, the monthly rate will cover salary, social insurance, administration, logistics, overhead etc.

Monthly income is just how much the employee earned monthly.
